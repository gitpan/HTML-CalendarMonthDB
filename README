DESCRIPTION
    HTML::CalendarMonthDB is a Perl module for generating, manipulating, and
    printing a HTML calendar grid for a specified month. It is intended as a
    faster and easier-to-use alternative to HTML::CalendarMonth. It is based
    on HTML::CalendarMonthSimple, but can store persistant data into a
    database, as well as adding features like per-event links, descriptions,
    and times.
        This module requires the Date::Calc module, which is available from
        CPAN.

INTERFACE METHODS

  new(ARGUMENTS)
    Naturally, new() returns a newly constructed calendar object. Recognized
    arguments include 'year' and 'month', to specify which month's calendar
    will be used. If either is omitted, the current value is used. An
    important note is that the month and the year are NOT the standard C or
    Perl -- use a month in the range 1-12 and a real year, e.g. 2001. If
    this is to be a persistant calendar (you wish to store info in a
    database), there are other arguments:

        * 'dbname' (name of database to use, required if you wish to use a
        database)
        * 'dbuser' (database user, default 'nobody')
        * 'dbpass' (database user password, default '')
        * 'dbcalendar' (database calendar name, default '')
        * 'dbclient' (database calendar client name, default '')
        * 'dbhost' (database host name, default '')

           # Examples:
           # Create a calendar for this month.
           $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple(); # not persistant
           # One for a specific month/year
           $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple('month'=>2,'year'=>2000); # not persistant
           # One for "the current month" in 1997
           $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple('year'=>1997); # not persistant
   
           # One for a specific month/year, to use database specified
           $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple('month'=>2,'year'=>2000,'dbname'=>'test','dbuser'=>postgres,'dbcalendar'=>'testcal','dbclient'=>'testClient');

  deldbevent (EVENTID)
    Permanently deletes record from database associated with the event id
    passed in.

  adddbevent (ARGUMENTS)
    Add persistant event for date (day) specified within current month and
    year. The following are arguments:

        * 'eventname' (name of event)
        * 'eventdesc' (event description, optional)
        * 'eventlink' (event link, optional)
        * 'eventtime' (event time, optional)
    =head2 addevent(DATE,STRING)

  getcontent(DATE)
    These methods are used to control the content of date cells within the
    calendar grid. The DATE argument may be a numeric date or it may be a
    string describing a certain occurrence of a weekday, e.g. "3MONDAY" to
    represent "the third Monday of the month being worked with", or it may
    be the plural of a weekday name, e.g. "wednesdays" to represent all
    occurrences of the given weekday. The weekdays are case-insensitive.

           # Examples:
           # The cell for the 15th of the month will now say something.
           $cal->setcontent(15,"An Important Event!");
           # Later down the program, we want the content to be boldfaced.
           $foo = "<b>" . $cal->getcontent(15) . "</b>";
           $cal->setcontent(15,$foo);
           # Or we could get extra spiffy:
           $cal->setcontent(15,"<b>" . $cal->getcontent(15) . "</b>");

           # addcontent() does not clober existing content.
           # Also, if you setcontent() to '', you've deleted the content.
           $cal->setcontent(16,'');
           $cal->addcontent(16,"<p>Hello World</p>");
           $cal->addcontent(16,"<p>Hello Again</p>");
           print $cal->getcontent(16); # Prints 2 sentences

           # Padded and decimal numbers may be used, as well:
           $cal->setcontent(3.14159,'Third of the month');
           $cal->addcontent('00003.0000','Still the third');
           $cal->getcontent('3'); # Gets the 2 sentences

           # The second Sunday of May is some holiday or another...
           $cal->addcontent('2sunday','Some Special Day') if ($cal->month() == 5);
           # So is the third wednesday of this month
           $cal->setcontent('3WedNEsDaY','Third Wednesday!');
           # What's scheduled for the second Friday?
           $cal->getcontent('2FRIDAY');

           # Every Wednesday and Friday of this month...
           $cal->addcontent('wednesdays','Every Wednesday!');
           $cal->getcontent('Fridays');

  as_HTML(ARGUMENTS)

  as_HTML_list(ARGUMENTS)
    These methods return a string containing the HTML calendar for the
    month. as_HTML() returns a standard 7 column table, while as_HTML_list()
    returns a two-column list format calendar.

           # Examples:
           print $cal->as_HTML();
           print $cal->as_HTML_list('editurl'=>'editcal.cgi', 'addurl'=>'addcal.cgi');

        Two optional arguments may be passed, in order to ease the integration
        of adminitrative front-ends: 'editurl' (Will add a [edit] link in each
        day's cell to specified url like so-
        http://editurl?date=month_day_year&calid=calendarid.) 'addurl' (Will add
        a [add] link in each day's cell to specified url like so-
        http://addurl?date=month_day_year&calid=calendarid.)

  year()

  month()

  monthname()
    These methods simply return the year/month of the calendar. monthname()
    returns the text name of the month, e.g. "December".

  getdbcontent()
    Loads calendar event content from database.

  getdbcalendar()
    Loads calendar formatting data from database.

  editdbcalendar(ARGUMENTS)
    Edits calendar formatting attributes stored in database. Takes any or
    all of the following arguments:

        * 'border' (size of calendar border, integer)
        * 'width' (width of calendar, should be in pixels or %)
        * 'bgcolor' (background color of calendar)
        * 'weekdaycolor' (background color of weekday cells)
        * 'weekendcolor' (background color of weekend cells)
        * 'todaycolor' (background color of today's cell)
        * 'bordercolor' (border color of calendar)
        * 'weekdaybordercolor' (border color of weekday cells)
        * 'weekendbordercolor' (border color of weekend cells)
        * 'todaybordercolor' (border color of today's cell)
        * 'contentcolor' (color of cell content)
        * 'weekdaycontentcolor' (color of weekday cell content)
        * 'weekendcontentcolor' (color of weekend cell content)
        * 'todaycontentcolor' (color of today's cell content)
        * 'headercolor' (background color of header cell)
        * 'weekdayheadercolor' (background color of weekday header cell)
        * 'weekendheadercolor' (background color of weekend header cell)
        * 'header' (header text, defaults to 'Month Year' if not specified or
        '')
        * 'cellalignment' (alignment of text within cells, defaults to left,
        other valid values include right, center)

  editdbevent(ARGUMENTS)
    Edits specific event attributes in database. Arguments:

        * 'eventid' (id of specific event, required)
        * 'eventname' (name of event)
        * 'eventdesc' (event description)
        * 'eventlink' (event link)
        * 'eventtime' (event time)

  getdbevent(DATE)
    Takes an argument of the date(day) and returns a hash of event id's and
    their attributes for the specified day in this form:
    hash{eventid}{eventattribute}

        Useful as a function to be used in admin tools.

  border([INTEGER])
    This specifies the value of the border attribute to the <TABLE>
    declaration for the calendar. As such, this controls the thickness of
    the border around the calendar table. The default value is 5.

        If a value is not specified, the current value is returned. If a value
        is specified, the border value is changed and the new value is returned.

  width([INTEGER][%])
    This sets the value of the width attribute to the <TABLE> declaration
    for the calendar. As such, this controls the horizintal width of the
    calendar.

        The width value can be either an integer (e.g. 600) or a percentage
        string (e.g. "80%"). Most web browsers take an integer to be the table's
        width in pixels and a percentage to be the table width relative to the
        screen's width. The default width is "100%".

        If a value is not specified, the current value is returned. If a value
        is specified, the border value is changed and the new value is returned.

           # Examples:
           $cal->width(600);    # absolute pixel width
           $cal->width("100%"); # percentage of screen size

  showdatenumbers([1 or 0])
    If showdatenumbers() is set to 1, then the as_HTML() method will put
    date labels in each cell (e.g. a 1 on the 1st, a 2 on the 2nd, etc.) If
    set to 0, then the date labels will not be printed. The default is 1.

        If no value is specified, the current value is returned.

        The date numbers are shown in boldface, normal size font. If you want to
        change this, consider setting showdatenumbers() to 0 and using
        setcontent()/addcontent() instead.

  showweekdayheaders([1 or 0])
    If showweekdayheaders() is set to 1 (the default) then calendars
    rendered via as_HTML() will display the names of the days of the week.
    If set to 0, the days' names will not be displayed.

        If no value is specified, the current value is returned.

  cellalignment([STRING])
    This sets the value of the align attribute to the <TD> tag for each
    day's cell. This controls how text will be centered/aligned within the
    cells.

        Any value can be used, if you think the web browser will find it
        interesting. Some useful alignments are: left, right, center, top, and
        bottom,

        By default, cells are aligned to the left.

  header([STRING])
    By default, the current month and year are displayed at the top of the
    calendar grid. This is called the "header".

        The header() method allows you to set the header to whatever you like.
        If no new header is specified, the current header is returned.

        If the header is set to an empty string, then no header will be printed
        at all. (No, you won't be stuck with a big empty cell!)

           # Example:
           # Set the month/year header to something snazzy.
           my($y,$m) = ( $cal->year() , $cal->monthname() );
           $cal->header("<center><font size=+2 color=red>$m $y</font></center>\n\n");

  bgcolor([STRING])

  weekdaycolor([STRING])

  weekendcolor([STRING])

  todaycolor([STRING])

  bordercolor([STRING])

  weekdaybordercolor([STRING])

  weekendbordercolor([STRING])

  todaybordercolor([STRING])

  contentcolor([STRING])

  weekdaycontentcolor([STRING])

  weekendcontentcolor([STRING])

  todaycontentcolor([STRING])

  headercolor([STRING])

  weekdayheadercolor([STRING])

  weekendheadercolor([STRING])
    These define the colors of the cells. If a string (which should be
    either a HTML color-code like '#000000' or a color-word like 'yellow')
    is supplied as an argument, then the color is set to that specified.
    Otherwise, the current value is returned. To un-set a value, try
    assigning the null string as a value.

        The bgcolor defines the color of all cells. The weekdaycolor overrides
        the bgcolor for weekdays (Monday through Friday), the weekendcolor
        overrides the bgcolor for weekend days (Saturday and Sunday), and the
        todaycolor overrides the bgcolor for today's date. (Which may not mean a
        lot if you're looking at a calendar other than the current month.)

        The weekdayheadercolor overrides the bgcolor for the weekday headers
        that appear at the top of the calendar if showweekdayheaders() is true,
        and weekendheadercolor does the same thing for the weekend headers. The
        headercolor overrides the bgcolor for the month/year header at the top
        of the calendar.

        The colors of the cell borders may be set: bordercolor determines the
        color of the calendar grid's outside border, and is the default color of
        the inner border for individual cells. The inner bordercolor may be
        overridden for the various types of cells via weekdaybordercolor,
        weekendbordercolor, and todaybordercolor.

        Finally, the color of the cells' contents may be set with contentcolor,
        weekdaycontentcolor, weekendcontentcolor, and todaycontentcolor. The
        contentcolor is the default color of cell content, and the other methods
        override this for the appropriate days' cells.

           # Example:
           $cal->bgcolor('white');                 # Set the default cell color
           $cal->bordercolor('green');             # Set the default border color
           $cal->contentcolor('black');            # Set the default content color
           $cal->headercolor('yellow');            # Set the color of the Month+Year header
           $cal->weekdayheadercolor('orange');     # Set the color of weekdays' headers
           $cal->weekendheadercolor('pink');       # Set the color of weekends' headers
           $cal->weekendcolor('palegreen');        # Override weekends' cell color
           $cal->weekendcontentcolor('blue');      # Override weekends' content color
           $cal->todaycolor('red');                # Override today's cell color
           $cal->todaycontentcolor('yellow');      # Override today's content color
           print $cal->as_HTML;                    # Print a really ugly calendar!
